### HELLO!
---
Greetings, dear reader! ðŸ‘‹

Hello and welcome to my personal developer blog! In this blog, I will be talking about a variety of topics mainly related to game/software development to some capacity.

### About the Author (The Boring Part)
---
I have always been interested in game development since a young age. After highschool, I finally get to kickstart my career by attending college completely online at Fullsail University for a bachelor's of arts in Game Design. During this time, I learned about not only the important concepts of game design but also writing game design documents, proposals, and even budgets! I also was taught how to make rapid prototypes to support all of this.

In my free time when I'm not playing video games, I often find myself either looking at some random game's code or I am working on a side project or an isolated experiment.

Before you reverse engineer a game, always ask yourself: **Is the developers okay with this?** Sometimes people don't like it when you put your nose in stuff. As a result, they often employ encryption or convert their code to
Intermediate language. If this is the case, I would check if the game supports harmony before continuing.

Seeing how other people write code interests me as it is a useful resource for learning new things and understanding current trends in the industry. It also helps me understand what practices to avoid doing when working on something. I also like to improve my code analysis abilities by coming up with a specific goal for understanding a specific game mechanic and map it out.


I like to think that I have a specialization in Unity3D. As a result, I quite often attempt to make things with it. Whether it is a full length side project or a one off experiment. I say "attempt" because I rarely finish these projects due to the lack of having project management skills or just getting bored/annoyed with what I'm working on. 

Side projects go through the full development cycle before fully being released to the public. After drafting the idea, I construct a prototype designed to show potential stakeholders what the game is potentially capable of. You can think of this as a pitch. Then, I collect data from everyone involved and continue with the software development cycle while making adjustments along the way to take feedback into account.

Experiments on the other hand are different. Often times I spontaneously come up with an idea for a mechanic or just want to play with a SDK or API. Other times, the result of experiments are code that can be reused in future projects. Either way, experiments are often short-lived.

As for playing video games, I mainly enjoy playing single player titles. I also have a history with FPS Shooter games but those days are mostly behind me for now.

After college, I managed to get a job as a contractor for Boeing where I spent the next 2.6 years of my life in Florida. At this role, I helped develop training simulations for aircraft mechanics in the US Navy. Shoutout to my ex-coworkers out there who are reading this! :heart:

In my department, teams were typically twelve people, including the project manager and the RTE. We followed the Scaled Agile framework (I won't explain this- just google it.) and used Unity3D to create the 3D environment. The software itself was heavy, and networked. As a result, networking and other things are managed on a backend using Redhat Linux Enterprise.

### You Still Awake?

Wowza. I can't believe I rambled this long about myself. Even I was bored to sleep from my own writing. I apologize ahead of time if you find spelling/grammar errors littered throughout my articles. No, I will not edit things in the future unless I find it myself.

Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope you got something out of that!

See ya!
